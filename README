This is a simple single-page JavaScript application to help
people generate a CAA policy.  It's available online at
<https://sslmate.com/caa>.

If you know of a CA that supports CAA which is not listed here, please
open an issue at <https://github.com/SSLMate/caa_helper/issues> or email
sslmate@sslmate.com.


LIMITATIONS

  * Does not support parameters to issue and issuewild.
  * Does not support multiple iodef properties.
  * Does not support properties besides issue, issuewild, and iodef.
  * Always generates at least one issue property, so it's not possible
    to create a policy which says "allow all CAs to issue non-wildcard
    certs, but only some/no CAs to issue wildcard certs."
